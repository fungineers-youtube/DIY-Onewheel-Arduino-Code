# DIY-Onewheel-Arduino-Code
Arduino code for the DIY Onewheel (from the Fungineers Youtube channel).
Project Brief: 
The project is to build a replica of the Onewheel at 1/4 the cost. 
Parts: Hub motor wheel, Vesc, Arduino, MPU6050, 10s2p battery (or whatever you like). Rails and enclosures (3D printed or aluminium, or a mixture of both).
About the code: 
The Arduino code is a working one. 
It takes the angle measurements from the Gyro (MPU), and converts them to a pwm signal between 1000 and 2000 and sends to the VESC.
